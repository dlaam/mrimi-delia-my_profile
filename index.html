						Do you know the City of Oujda in Morocco? Located northeast of the kingdom, it is still a city very traditional and conservative, that is tending to develop. This city embodies, between traditions and modernism, my mother breeding line.

						A part of my family find her roots in Algeria, more precisely in Mostaganem. Although less close to this culture, especially since the border was closed, I remain impressed by their patriotism, which they claim at the slightest opportunity...

			</p>

				<p>
					Morocco, Algeria, Brittany, these three cultures have brought up my education. Therefore, my cooking represents this multiculturalism. 
					Sweet or savoury, appetisers or good dishes, sophisticated or traditional, no matter I cook everything and I love it. SO, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, either to test new recipes or to improve the ones I already know.
